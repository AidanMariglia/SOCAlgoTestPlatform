\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
Battery state of charge (SOC) estimation requires specialized algorithms. Standardized testing is needed to identify which SOC estimation approaches proposed yearly are the best. The current online SOC estimation algorithm testing tool is based on Matlab and receives submissions through a Google form, then the algorithms are tested in serial on a McMaster server. This is not scalable, as tests usually take an hour or more to complete. In addition, the software regularly crashes due to unhandled errors from the submitted algorithms. The final product will be scaled up to have several hundred active users and be used with multiple algorithm submissions at a time.
\subsection{Goals of the Project}

    The final product can test multiple algorithm submissions in parallel - since each algorithm takes approximately an hour to complete, running them in parallel will help reduce the overall time required to run all algorithms.
    
    The final product generates reports and compares algorithm performance - the reports will summarize the performance of the submitted algorithm and compare it with other submitted algorithms, helping users understand and visualize their results.
    
    The final product can handle any error encountered throughout the algorithm’s runtime - this will minimize the software’s crashes and downtime and overall, it will increase the reliability of the software. It will make debugging much easier and as a result, improve the user experience.
    
    The final product is secure and prevents malware attacks - secure software is necessary to protect users’ sensitive data as well as keep the software’s integrity and availability.

\subsection{Individual Product Use Cases (PUC's)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A user creates a battery testing algorithm and wants it to be tested to see how efficient it is. They submit the algorithm to the system and after the system has completed the tests, it outputs the results back to the user.
    \item A user navigates to the leaderboard screen to check what the current best algorithm for testing batteries is and which user created it. The system outputs the updated leaderboard results to the user.
    \item A user navigates to their account page and wants to view the results of all algorithms they have submitted previously. The system will display these previous submissions to the user.
    \item A user navigates to the main page of the website and inputs their information. The system inputs this system and requests an administrator reviews the information for correctness. Once the administrator has verified the information, the system will create the account for the user.
    \item A user forgets their password and sends a request to the system to reset it. An administrator creates a new temporary password for the user and sets the users current password to this temporary one. The system notifies the user of this new password.
    \item An administrator wants to delete a user account for violating terms of service. They submit a request to the system to delete this user account and the system ensures it is deleted.
    \item An administrator discovers new tests that they want to include within the script that the system runs against user algorithms. The administrator uploads this new script within the system and the system now runs the new script.

    \item Explore different AWS pricing
\end{itemize}

\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}
N/A - This system is a rebuild of an existing application (Borealis), for which there are no existing solutions on the market.
\subsection{Reusable Components}
\begin{itemize}
    \item REACT
    \item AWS
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kaggle: The format of Kaggle fits our use case well, with the difference being the type of algorithms being evaluated. Kaggle can be used as a guide for how the front end of the service should function.
\end{itemize}

\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
Since this is a completely new system, users will have to adapt and learn how to use it and potentially change their workflow. 
\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In this case, while some software will be reused from the existing system, the new system is intended to replace the existing system, so they will not interact. The old system will be decommissioned after the new system is deployed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Potential User Problems}
It is possible that performance and scaling issues could arise while using the system which could cause users to get frustrated with the system. It is also possible that the submitted algorithms might not work with the system due to different versioning/ if the system is implemented in GnuOctave instead of Matlab and certain libraries or methods fails to work. Other potential issues could be problems with usability and security. To mitigate these concerns, regular feedback from stakeholders should be taken. Also, sufficient performance and security testing will be needed.

\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use of Matlab; we need to either run many concurrent instances of a Matlab interpreter or efficiently compile Matlab code repeatedly to execute user submissions. We may encounter issues with either licensing or product performance here
    \item Cloud Costs: Using AWS for hosting the execution backend may be prohibitively expensive
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In the event the product achieves widespread use, the cost of computing may be too high to support the product with a large number of users (1000s of concurrent users)
\end{itemize}

\section{Tasks}

\subsection{Planning of the Development Phases}
\begin{itemize}
\item Proof of Concept stage:
This stage aims to provide the basic functionality of the new system, accept an algorithm submission, run it against the existing test script, and report the results back to the user. This stage must be operational by November 11th, 2024. The operational environment components involved are the hosting provider used for the front end, as well as the hosting provider used for the back end (these may not necessarily be the same). The function requirements involved at this stage are
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system shall allow users to submit algorithms to be tested 
\item The system shall report the results of submitted algorithms when their testing is complete
\item The system shall allow for multiple submissions from users to run in parallel. 
\end{itemize}

None of the non-functional requirements are in scope at this stage

\item Revision 0 stage:
This stage aims to provide the first working version of the system with complete functionality. This stage must be complete by February 3rd, 2025. All operational environment components are involved, as are all functional and non-functional requirements
	
\item Revision 1 stage:
This stage aims to provide an improved complete version of the system, based on the learnings from the development and testing of revision 0. This stage must be completed by March 17th, 2024. Once again all operational environment components are involved, as are all requirements. Additional requirements not discovered before the revision 0 stage may enter the scope here and be included in this development phase.  
\end{itemize}


\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
N/A - The existing system had no accounts/history or storage of results since results were emailed directly to users.

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
N/A - Existing results of previously submitted algorithms can be discarded once users switch to the new system.

\section{Costs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item During the development and testing phase, the application will not be under heavy load so cloud hosting costs should be less than \$100
\end{itemize}

\section{User Documentation and Training}
\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}
As part of user documentation, the software will come with a user guide as well as walkthroughs that are built into the application, similar to how GitHub presents its tutorials.

\subsection{Training Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hints will be provided for new functionality to help board new users
    \item Video explanations can be added for complex components of the application
\end{itemize}

\section{Waiting Room}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Submit algorithms in a variety of other programming languages (not exclusively accepting matlab algorithms)
\end{itemize}

\section{Ideas for Solution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SHARCNET
    \item AWS ECS
    \item AWS MATLAB prebuilt machine image
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain-specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Nathan Uy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Being a team player is crucial to completing this project. Effective communication skills are necessary to manage conflicts and convey priorities and expectations from one another. Planning effectively, adapting to change, and problem-solving will also be needed throughout the project development since there will be changes in the requirements, tight deadlines and other unexpected changes that the team should be prepared for.
\end{itemize} 
\textbf{Declan Young}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developing knowledge of best practices for both frontend and backend development to ensure that the two work together seamlessly is another critical aspect of the success of this capstone project. Since there are multiple components that must work together in order for the application being developed to function efficiently and effectively, it will be important to ensure that each performs as expected individually, but also when iterating with each other. 
\end{itemize} 
\textbf{Benjamin Dubois}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Knowledge of configuring and maintaining a server will be crucial for our success in this capstone project. For this project, we will be developing a server that will allow for submissions to be tested in parallel and the majority of our project depends on this being successful as this is the number one requirement of our stakeholders.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Aidan Mariglia}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Success for this project hinges on our ability to manage many concurrently executing backend jobs, ensuring that throughput is high enough to provide a smooth experience to our users, while not producing high hosting costs. Managing a many concurrent job is a frequent task in backend engineering, so the skill most important to the success of this project is backend design.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Team Working skills}
\begin{itemize}
\item Experience working in a team will help us acquire great communication skills, project management skills and conflict management skills. Participating in team-building activities or any hands-on team activities can also strengthen these skills. We will ensure to continually engage within our group to enhance our communication skills and project management skills and do retrospectives on how we could improve next time.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Best practices for both frontend and backend}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first approach that can be used is referencing documentation, textbooks, research or other references on best practices to ensure that both the frontend and backend are developed properly. Additionally, using this information will allow our group to acquire a significant amount of knowledge and skills regarding these topics, which will allow us to make more informed decisions on less standard topics and issues related to these fields that we are encountering throughout the duration of the project.
    \item Another approach is experimenting with different technologies to see how different frontend and backend frameworks and technologies interact with each other. This will give us examples of different approaches to frontend and backend development, which we can apply to each iteration of the project.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Knowledge of configuring and maintaining a server}
\begin{itemize}
\item The first approach to gaining this knowledge can be working on a test system and experimenting with features to ensure we know what works well and what we need to improve on. This can be considered the trial and error approach as if we make any changes on this test server that cause major issues, it is not a problem.
\item Another approach that can be used is referencing online tutorials and walkthroughs from experts in this field. There are millions of videos available that can be very helpful in gaining this knowledge. This is the approach that our team is going to pursue as it is more efficient than trial and error and does not require the setup of a test server. 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Backend Design}
\begin{itemize}
\item The first approach to gaining this knowledge is studying theory. Many resources exist which discuss design patterns and other techniques which aid in efficient backend design. Studying these techniques provides a developer with the necessary background knowledge to make the correct design decisions.
\item The second approach to gaining backend design knowledge is experience. Through designing many systems, and making mistakes, an intuitive knowledge is gained for backend design methodology, making future decisions easier and previous mistakes avoidable. This is the approach which will be used by the team, in order to leverage our existing co-op work experience.
\end{itemize}
